    { "q": "One advantage of an RIS is that it can integrate with a referring doctor's EHR system to provide easier patient data access.", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "According to the text, using an RIS leads to slower insurance payments because verification happens after the patient visit.", "a": "False" },

    { "q": "Cardiology Information Systems (CIS) are mainly focused on the storage and retrieval of radiology-centric images.", "a": "False" },
    { "q": "A CIS usually receives an order with patient demographics from other imaging management systems.", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "Most Cardiology Information Systems include extensive post-processing functions for image manipulation.", "a": "False" },
    { "q": "The technical specifics of cardiology information systems in the 1970s originated from a mainframe environment.", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "Modular systems in the 1980s emphasized the use of real-time applications and mini computers for CIS.", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "The introduction of the Internet was a turning point that shifted the focus of CIS towards creating larger, more centralized systems.", "a": "False" },
    { "q": "A key benefit of a CIS is providing ease of access to patient data while maintaining security.", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "A CIS consolidates multiple types of patient cardiology information, eliminating the need for doctors to request results from different departments.", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "Flexibility in the workflow is a feature of CIS that allows physicians and nurses to assess patient data from a single platform.", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "The 'Enhanced Comparability' of a CIS makes it more difficult for healthcare professionals to retrieve past data for comparison.", "a": "False" },

    { "q": "A Cardiology Information System cannot be integrated with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems.", "a": "False" },
    { "q": "Integrating a CIS with an EHR can enhance the quality of services and provide a more comprehensive view of the patient care spectrum.", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "A Radiology Information System (RIS) is described as a networked software system for managing medical imagery and associated data.", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "An RIS is often used in conjunction with a PACS and a VNA.", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "According to the 'Key Points to Remember', one of the benefits of CIS is enhanced comparability.", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "The functionalities of a CIS are limited to remote access and EHR integration only.", "a": "False" },
    { "q": "The 'Key Points to Remember' state that RIS functions include patient tracking and billing.", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "A Hospital Information System (HIS) is a healthcare technology used for short-term and long-term storage of images.", "a": "False" },
    { "q": "A VNA makes medical imaging data accessible through different picture archiving and communication systems (PACS).", "a": "True" },
    { "q": "The evolution of CIS began with modular systems in the 1970s and mainframe environments in the 1980s.", "a": "False" },
